This program allows users to simulate ordering various goodies from the Hogwarts Express trolley. Users input the quantity of each candy item they desire, and the program calculates and displays the total cost, including the wizard tax. The code utilizes constant variables for item prices and tax rate, ensuring accuracy and flexibility as prices change. This repository provides a clear example of basic C++ input/output operations, variable usage, and mathematical calculations, all while maintaining a user-friendly interface of the wizarding world.
